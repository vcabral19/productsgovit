Description: AddRemoveWidget + ComboBoxWidget
        	
        	by Martin Aspeli <optilude@gmx.net>
        
        This is a replacement for KeywordWidget which permits you to add items from
        a vocabulary (and optionally new items) using a pair of selection boxes with
        "add" and "remove" buttons to transfer items between them. It overlaps in
        functionality with InAndOutWidget, but does not suffer from InAndOut's 
        requirement for all items in the "target" list to be selection upon form
        submission. I believe InAndOut does not allow textual items to be added
        by the user, though it does support adding of referenced objects, which
        AddRemove does not. You are advised to test both to find out which one is 
        more suitable for your needs.
        
        Optionally AddRemoveWidget supports keywords ordering.
        
        Please see the docstring in AddRemoveWidget.py for a list of options you
        may pass to the widget to configure it.
        
        You can also use the widget standalone, by defining a couple of variables
        (notably fieldName and vocabulary) and include the macro add_remove_box from
        widget_addremove.pt. See the comment in that file for details.
        
        Also included is a ComboBoxWidget - it can be seen as supporting the same
        use case, when only one item may be selected. It presents a selection box
        from which to select a value, and a text box to enter an "other" value if
        none of the items in the list are sufficient.
        
        Again, see the docstring in ComboBoxWidget.py, and the comment in
        widget_combobox.pt for details on how to use it within and outside
        Archetypes.

        1.4 - 2008-09-10
        ----------------
        
        * Fixed error with duplication of entries in the Available column. This fixes
          issue #9.
          [dunlapm]
        
        * Fixed the long-standing issue with non-ascii characters in terms gathered from
          the catalog. Proper vocabularies should be just that, proper vocabularies
          where the "id" of a term consists of ascii characters and the "value" can
          contain unicode. Check the Vocabulary class in Products.Archetypes for a
          reference.
