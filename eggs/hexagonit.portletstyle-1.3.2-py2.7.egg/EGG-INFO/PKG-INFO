Description: ===============================
        Assign a CSS style to a portlet
        ===============================
        
        `hexagonit.portletstyle` is a Plone 4.x add-on that allows you to assign a CSS
        style to a portlet. You can chose from a list of pre-defined (configurable
        through Plone Control Panel) classes.
        
        * `Source code @ GitHub <http://github.com/hexagonit/hexagonit.portletstyle>`_
        * `Releases @ PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/hexagonit.portletstyle>`_
        * `Sphinx docs @ ReadTheDocs <http://readthedocs.org/docs/hexagonitportletstyle>`_
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        To install ``hexagonit.portletstyle`` you simply add
        ``hexagonit.portletstyle`` to the list of eggs in your buildout, run
        buildout and restart Plone. Then, install `hexagonit.portletstyle` using the
        Add-ons control panel.
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Click on ``Manage portlets`` and add or edit a portlet. Select your desired
        portlet style from the `Portlet Style` drop-down menu and save. That's it.
        
        
        Default portlet styles
        ======================
        
        By default, this package gives you three default portlet styles:
        
        * ``No header``
        * ``No footer``
        * ``No header and no footer``
        
        
        Managing available portlet styles
        =================================
        
        You can add, edit and remove available portlet styles by going to the `Plone
        Control Panel` and clicking on the ``Portlet Styles`` configlet. Pointing your
        browser directly to ``http://<zope_ip>:<zope_port>/<plone_id>/@@portletstyles``
        also does the trick.
        
        Here, you can enter your styles, one by line, with a pipe (``|``) character
        delimiting CSS class and style title. For example, a line ``dummy|Dummy style``
        would produce a ``Dummy style`` drop-down menu item that would give the portlet
        an additional CSS class of ``foo``.
        
        Lines are checked for formatting and validity of CSS classes. One style can have
        multiple CSS classes, for example, the following is valid:
        ``one two|Double class style``.
        
        
        Supported portlets
        ==================
        
        As of this moment, the following portlets are supported (as in, you can select
        a style when editing them):
        
        * `Collection portlet`
        * `Events portlet`
        * `Navigation portlet`
        * `News portlet`
        * `Recently changed items portlet`
        * `RSS portlet`
        * `Search portlet`
        * `Static text portlet`
        
        The rest of out-of-the-box Plone portlets are non-editable ones as you normally
        need only one instance per site. For these (and other) reasons the following
        portlets *do not support* choosing a style for them:
        
        * `Calendar portlet`
        * `Classic portlet`
        * `Language portlet`
        * `Login portlet`
        * `Review portlet`
        
        TODO
        ====
        
        * use in the wild
        * maybe patch non-editable portlets (login, calendar, etc.)
        * check how `collective.weightedportlets` patches portlets and learn from it
