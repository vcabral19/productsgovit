Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        collective.referencedatagridfield is a mix of Reference and DataGrid fields for
        Plone.  This is a sophisticated reference field with its own widget for adding
        and deleting references for both internal and external resources. Having
        complete support for Archetype's Reference field functionality, it also allows
        external links management.
        
        This package functionality is based on DataGridField, DataGridWidget and
        Archetype's Reference field with ATReferenceBrowserWidget. It allows Plone
        developers to extend default Plone Reference field functionality or override
        existing Reference field functionality with a custom one. 
        
        Required Products.DataGridField package is automatically installed during
        installation procedure.

        your site for the necessary object you want to add.  Type in desirable title
        into the Title field. If you leave it empty - it will automatically be filled
        with the inserted object title.
