Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Several Plone products have a need to handle simple attachments: content
        types that do not have a workflow of their own but will reuse the
        permissions on their container. SimpleAttachment implements simple file
        and image attachment types that can serve this need.
        
        SimpleAttachment is released under the GNU General Public Licence, version 2.
        Please see http://gnu.org for more details.
        
        Acknowledgements
        ================
        
        These types were taken from the RichDocument product, which now uses our types.

          blobs
          [stefan, ggozad]
        
        4.1 (2011-10-19)
        ----------------
        
        - Added a view to provide filename normalizations since PloneTool's
          normalizeString does not do it any more.
          [ggozad, stefan]
        
        - Schema extend from p.a.blobs extension fields. Add an index_html to
          FileAttachment to fix partial downloads.

          [petschki]
        
        - Removed transform cache from file attachment, but leave cache invalidation
          in place. Reducing the size of the Data.fs is important.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Removed the `SimpleAttachment` spelling of the GenericSetup profile. Use
          `profile-Products.SimpleAttachment:default` instead.
          [hannosch]

        3.3 (2010-04-21)
        ----------------
        
        - have import step handle kupu and tiny mce and not rely
          on kupu being there since it's not the default in Plone 4
          [vangheem]
        
        
        3.2 (2010-04-21)
        ----------------

          [vincentfretin]
        
        - Adding missing history file and resurrecting the past contributions.
          [andrewb]
        
        - Reconfigure test setup.  Ensure that our zcml configuration deferred until
          the setup of the Plone site testing layer.  Helps for use with roadrunner
          [andrewb]
