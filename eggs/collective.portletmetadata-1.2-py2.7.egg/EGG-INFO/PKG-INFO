        About
        -----
        
        collective.portletmetadata is a collection of patches that makes it possible edit
        settings for each portlet assignment. We denote these settings for metadata thereby
        the name of the product.
        
        Out of the box the product provides the following features:
        
        * Possibility for creating local portlets, i.e. portlets that will not be inherited
          even though child settings imply so.
        * Possibility for adding a CSS class for a portlet assignment. These are defined
          in the controlpanel (stored in registry).
        * Possibility for excluding a portlet from being indexed by Google.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Whenever the product is installed a "*" will be visible in the @@manage-portlets
        view for each assignment. Whenever the user selects this option, he/she can edit
        the metadata as described above.

        Ideally, this feature should be built into plone.app.portlets as described in
        `PLIP 12266 <https://dev.plone.org/ticket/12266>`_ the current milestone is set to
        Plone 5, but until Plone 5 is a reality this product can be used.

        Changes
        =======
        
        1.2 (2014-04-22)
        ----------------
        
        - Allow ``class|descriptive title`` as format in the control panel.
          When this format is used, we show the title in de portlet metadata
          edit form.  A simple ``class`` is of course still supported.
          [maurits]
        
        - Support the local portlet checkbox for ContentWellPortlets.
