        Installation
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        To enable this product in a buildout-based installation:
        
        1. Edit your buildout.cfg and add ``sc.embedder`` to the list of eggs to install:
        
        .. code-block:: ini
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                sc.embedder
        
        After updating the configuration you need to run ''bin/buildout'', which will
        take care of updating your system.
        
        Go to the 'Site Setup' page in a Plone site and click on the 'Add-ons' link.
        
        Check the box next to `sc.embedder`` and click the 'Activate' button.
        
        Use
        ^^^
        
        Once the product is installed you will note that you are available to add a
        Embedder content type. When you attempt to add an item you will see the
        fields:
        
        - Content URL
        - Description
        - Embed html code
        - Width
        - Height
        - Player position
        - Body text
        - Alternate content
        - Image
        
        In the URL field you must put the url of you content. For example:
        
            http://vimeo.com/17914974
        
        and then click the *load* button. This will automatically populate the form
        with some data from the third party content. Which fields are populated depends
        on the individual provider. But in most cases the fields: title, description, width,
        height and embed html fields will be filled.
        
        **Note**: *Some providers only support width, height and title. So the fields
        like description or html embed code will need to be filled manually.
        This information is normally found in the page where the url points to*.
        
        Layout
        ^^^^^^
        With *player position* field you can set where the embed multimedia is going
        to be render regarding the body text. You have the options *top, bottom, left
        and right*.
        
        Body text will be the main information that will describe the content.
        
        The *alternate content* is to give a description or transcription to an
        individual that is no able to hear. In the layout this is hidden by default.
        There is a link called **alternate content** that will show or hide again the
        content of this field by clicking on it.
        
        The *Image* field is just to assign an image to the object that will give a
        quick visual description of the content. The idea is to show it in listing
        views or covers.
