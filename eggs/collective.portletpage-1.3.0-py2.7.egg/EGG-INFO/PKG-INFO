        Overview
        ========
        
        After installing this product, you will be able to add a "Portlet Page".
        
        This is like a standard Plone Page, but it also has a "*Manage portlets*" tab, from
        which you may assign portlets into four slots. The portlets will be shown on the main
        view of the content.

           :alt: Managing content's portlets
        
        Use of other content data like title, description and body text can be avoided, making the Portlet
        Page simply a portlet container.
        
        This product is great for providing to your Plone sites a tool for building the site *homepage*,
        or the home for a site subsection.

        - restored Plone 3 compatibility
          [keul]
        
        - Plone 4.1 compatibility
          [keul]
        
        - updated translation to be Plone 4.1 compatible; this will probably
          make some label untranslable on Plone 3
          [keul]
        
        1.1b1 (2011-05-27)
        ------------------
        
        - changed ``content_meta_type`` from ``Portlet Page`` to ``PortletPage``
          that was breaking sorting (see `#8161`__).
          [keul]
        
        - removed from ``IPortletPage`` interface the ``subtitle`` field, not
          used anywhere.
          [keul]
        
        - added ``portletPageColumn`` class to every portlet column.
          [keul]
        
        - title field is not required anymore.
          [keul]
        
        - when not provided, title, description and body are not shown in the
          view (this partially deprecate the need of additional products
          like `redturtle.portletpage.views`__).
          [keul]
        
        - added a CSS ``clear`` rule at the last column.
          [nekorin]
        
        - added a CSS rules for hack Sunburst behaviour with DD elements
          (see `#11840`__)
          [nekorin]
        
        - do not display a portlets container if empty.
          [keul]
        
        - added translation support, both i18n and locales
          (i18n is the only way right now to translate some stuff).
          [keul]
        
        - changed the "*Portlets*" action tab to "*Manage portlet*".
          [keul]
        
        - changes the ``i18n:domain`` of the configure.zcml of the
          browser module to "plone" (this is not formally right but,
          again, is needed for really translate views name).
          [keul]
        
        - expanded left or right column if one of the two is missing,
          filling all space available.
          [keul]
        
        - the Plone 4 "Hide" portlet now works also there.
          [keul]
        
        - updated tests to reflect changes
