Description: Plone hotfix, 2016-04-19
        ========================
        
        This hotfix fixes several security issues:
        
        - An unauthorized changing of dexterity content in Plone.  Archetypes content is not affected.
        - An attacker can potentially gain information on the ID of private content on your site.  This is for all content.
        - A user who can create or edit templates can bypass Restricted Python.  This is only when Chameleon is used, via the ``five.pt`` package.
        
        This hotfix should be applied to the following versions of Plone:
        
        * Plone 5.0.4 and any version prior
        * Plone 4.3.9 and any version prior
        * Any older version of Plone
        
        The hotfix is officially supported by the Plone security team on the
        following versions of Plone in accordance with the Plone
        `version support policy`_: 4.0.10, 4.1.6, 4.2.7, 4.3.9 and 5.0.4.
        However it has also received some testing on older versions of Plone.
        The fixes included here will be incorporated into subsequent releases of Plone,
        so Plone 4.3.10, 5.0.5 and greater should not require this hotfix.

          "Could not apply". This may indicate that you have a non-standard Plone
          installation.
        
        Q: How can I report problems installing the patch?
          A: Contact the Plone security team at security@plone.org, or visit the

        Q: How can I report other potential security vulnerabilities?
          A: Please email the security team at security@plone.org rather than discussing
          potential security issues publicly.
