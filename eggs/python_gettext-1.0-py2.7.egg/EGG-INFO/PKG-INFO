Description: Overview
        ========
        
        This implementation of Gettext for Python includes a Msgfmt class which can be
        used to generate compiled mo files from Gettext po files and includes support
        for the newer msgctxt keyword. The idea for this project had been rather
        ambitious, but never lived up to what is was supposed to do. Look at Babel
        (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Babel) for a package more worthy of this packages'
        name.
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.0 - 2009-05-23
        ----------------
        
        - Updated package description and metadata, relicense from GPL to BSD. Note
          about Babel which supersedes this package in all possible ways.

        0.6 - 2007-11-02
        ----------------
        
        - Fixed header parsing.

        0.5 - 2007-11-01
        ----------------
        
        - Optimized file parsing by using more elif clauses and avoiding an insane
          number of startswith and isinstance calls.

        0.4 - 2007-10-13
        ----------------
        
        - Added header_only argument to the read method, that allows to only parse
          the header of a file without reading and parsing all the messages.

        0.3 - 2007-08-25
        ----------------
        
        - Added an explicit read method, which only parses the po file and stores
          it in the messages dict, but does not compile it.

        0.2 - 2007-08-23
        ----------------
        
        - Bumped version number to accommodate the number in the egg info.
          [hannosch]
        
        0.1 - 2007-06-19
        ----------------
        
        - Initial implementation of a Msgfmt class which supports the generation of
          Gettext mo files including support for the new msgctxt keyword.
