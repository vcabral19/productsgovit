Description: plone4.csrffixes
        ================
        
        The package aims to backport the auto CSRF implementation from Plone 5
        to Plone 4.
        
        The reason this is necessary is because there are a lot of CSRF problem
        with the ZMI that Zope2 will never be able to fix.
        
        See https://plone.org/products/plone/security/advisories/security-vulnerability-20151006-csrf
        for more details.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        
        Plone 4.3, 4.2, 4.1 and 4.0
        ---------------------------
        
        add `plone4.csrffixes` to eggs list::
        
            eggs =
                ...
                plone4.csrffixes
                ...
        
        
        add a new version pin for plone.protect, plone.keyring and plone.locking::
        
            [versions]
            ...
            plone.keyring = 3.0.1
            plone.locking = 2.0.8
            plone.protect = 3.0.16
            ...
        
        
        Plone 4.0 and 4.1
        -----------------
        
        If lxml is not already included in your site, this package has a dependency
        on lxml and will pull it in when installed.
        
        We recommend pinning to version 2.3.6 of lxml. If you use a version of lxml > 3,
        you'll need to also install the ``cssselect`` package. Since version
        1.0.4 we require ``cssselect`` in our ``setup.py`` so it is
        automatically installed.
        
        
        
        Additional addon versions
        -------------------------
        
        To prevent some write on read errors that might cause false
        positives with the auto csrf protection, these version pins have
        been reported to work upgrading to::
        
            Products.CMFQuickInstallerTool = 3.0.12
            Products.PlonePAS = 5.0.4
        
        
        
        
        Robot framework
        ---------------
        
        plone4.csrffixes registers via z3c.autoinclude for Plone instances and is not
        loaded in tests.
        
        You need to include plone4.csrffixes in your package configure.zcml for it to
        load in your tests:
        
        <include package="plone4.csrffixes" />
