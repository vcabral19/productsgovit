Description: Python-oembed
        ====
        
        This library provides a pure python OEmbed consumer to get resources from OEmbed providers.
        
        Based on reference from http://oembed.com/
        
        oEmbed is a format for allowing an embedded representation of a URL on third party sites. The simple API allows a website to display embedded content (such as photos or videos) when a user posts a link to that resource, without having to parse the resource directly.
        
        OEmbed format authors:
        
        * Cal Henderson (cal at iamcal.com)
        * Mike Malone (mjmalone at gmail.com)
        * Leah Culver (leah.culver at gmail.com)
        * Richard Crowley (r at rcrowley.org)
        
        Install
        ------------
        
            pip install python-oembed
        
        Use
        ------------
        
        To create an instance of the oEmbed consumer:
        
            >>> import oembed
            >>> consumer = oembed.OEmbedConsumer()
        
        To add a provider endpoint to this consumer: 
        
        * The first parameter is the URL of the endpoint published by the provider.
        * The second parameter is the URL schema to use with this endpoint.
        
        For example:
        
            >>> endpoint = oembed.OEmbedEndpoint('http://www.flickr.com/services/oembed', ['http://*.flickr.com/*'])
            >>> consumer.addEndpoint(endpoint)
        
        To get the provider response for a URL:
        
            >>> response = consumer.embed('http://www.flickr.com/photos/wizardbt/2584979382/')
        
        To print the response results (each field can be read as a python dict, None if empty):
        
            >>> import pprint
            >>> pprint.pprint(response.getData())
            >>> print response['url']
        
        To read the full documentation:
        
            $ pydoc oembed
        
        Test
        ------------
        
            cd python-oembed
            python oembed_test.py
