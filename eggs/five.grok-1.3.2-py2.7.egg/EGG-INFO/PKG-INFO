        Introduction
        ------------
        
        `five.grok` is a development layer for Zope 2, based on Grok framework
        concepts.
        
        The development techniques are similar to the ones used with Grok
        framework.
        
        It is based on `grokcore` namespace packages that were factored out of Grok
        framework.
        
        Implemented features
        --------------------
        
        Coming from Grok, the following components are available to Zope 2
        developers:
        
        - Zope 3 Component (Adapter, Global utilities, Subscribers),
        
        - Permissions,
        
        - Views and Viewlets,
        
        - Skins and resources directories,
        
        - Page Templates (using the Zope 2 Page Templates),
        
        - Formlib forms (optional, you need to include the extra ``form``),
        
        - Local sites and local utilities,
        
        - Annotations,
        
        - Layout (optional, you need to include the extra ``layout``).
        
        All those components are available with exactly the same syntax than
        in grok. You just have to do::
        
          from five import grok
        
        Instead of::
        
          import grok
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        After adding the dependency to ``five.grok`` in your project, you have
        to load the following ZCML::
        
          <include package="five.grok" />
        
        Note
        ~~~~
        
        And for this release we recommend to pin down the following version in
        your buildout::
        
          five.formlib = 1.0.4
          five.localsitemanager = 2.0.5
          grokcore.annotation = 1.3
          grokcore.component = 2.5
          grokcore.formlib = 1.9
          grokcore.layout = 1.5.1
          grokcore.security = 1.6.1
          grokcore.site = 1.6.1
          grokcore.view = 2.7
          grokcore.viewlet = 1.10.1
          martian = 0.14
        
        
        Zope 2.13 is required. If you wish to use a previous version of Zope
        2, look at five.grok 1.0 for Zope 2.10.x or five.grok 1.2 for Zope 2.12.x.
        
        
        More information
        ----------------
        
        You can refer to the Grok website: http://grok.zope.org/, and the Grok
        documentation: http://grok.zope.org/documentation/.
        
        You can check the doctest included in sources as well.
