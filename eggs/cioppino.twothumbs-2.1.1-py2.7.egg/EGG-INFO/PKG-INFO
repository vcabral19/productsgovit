Description: Introduction
        ============
        This will add those terribly "delish" little thumbs all over facebook
        to products of your choosing. By default, only logged in users can rate
        a product, and once they are logged in they can vote once (and change
        their vote at any time)
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        .. image:: https://secure.travis-ci.org/collective/cioppino.twothumbs.png
            :target: http://travis-ci.org/#!/collective/cioppino.twothumbs
        
        .. image:: https://coveralls.io/repos/collective/cioppino.twothumbs/badge.png?branch=master
            :alt: Coverage
            :target: https://coveralls.io/r/collective/cioppino.twothumbs
        
        
        Your mission, should you choose to accept it is to add the package to
        your buildout config and rerun buildout. If you want it as a viewlet
        below the content title, you must follow the viewlet directions below
        before restarting and installing. Otherwise install immediately and then
        skip to the section on browser views.
        
        Make sure you have installed or "Activated" the product if things aren't
        working as expected.
        
        
        Compatability
        -------------
        
        cioppino.twothumbs works with Plone 4.0, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 and 5.0
        
        
        As a Viewlet
        ------------
        
        Archetypes
        ^^^^^^^^^^
        Then, in the configure.zcml
        in the base of your product you need to tell which content types should
        display the thumbs. For example, with the PloneSoftwareCenter product,
        the configure.zcml has the lines::
        
            <include package="cioppino.twothumbs" />
            <class class=".content.project.PSCProject">
               <implements interface="cioppino.twothumbs.interfaces.ILoveThumbsDontYou" />
            </class>
        
        That little diddy would add the thumbs viewlet to the PSCProject
        product only. You only need to include the package 1 time but you
        need to add the class block for every content type you would like
        to show the thumbs.
        
        Dexterity
        ^^^^^^^^^
        Cioppino.TwoThumbs provides a behavior for dexterity content types. In
        the dexterity configuration UI, it will be listed under "Behaviors".
        
        You may also manually add this behavior to your type by adding the following
        to ``../path/to/profiles/default/types/your_type.xml``::
        
            ...
            <property name="behaviors">
                <element value="cioppino.twothumbs.interfaces.ILoveThumbsDontYou" />
                ...
            </property>
            ...
        
        
        As a Browser View
        -----------------
        Additionally, you can generate the widget on any content page in any place
        by just adding a few lines to your template::
        
            <div tal:content="structure here/@@rate-if-you-dare"/>
        
        Note that this ONLY works if the browser view is in context of a content
        type since it requires access to content object annotations.
        
        
        Migration
        ---------
        If you used to use plone.contentratings and want to migrate to the thumbs
        product, there is an example in PloneSoftwareCenter. It's
        pretty easy. Please see https://github.com/collective/Products.PloneSoftwareCenter/blob/master/Products/PloneSoftwareCenter/Extensions/migrateratings.py for an example.
        
        
        Anonymous Voting
        ----------------
        Anonymous voting is possible, but **weak**. An unique identifier is
        generated and set as cookie on first vote. Then the uid is used as
        identifier for later display/changes. To enable anonymous voting go to
        Plones configuration registry, search for ``cioppino.twothumbs.anonymous``
        entry and edit it. Alternativly you can add your own ``registry.xml`` to
        your sites profile::
        
            <?xml version="1.0"?>
            <registry>
                <record name="cioppino.twothumbs.anonymousvoting">
                    <value>True</value>
                </record>
            </registry>
        
        It's easy to fake anonymous votes, so dont trust them much. A todo here
        is to add a captcha, which would make automated vote-faking impossible.

        -------
        This product was initially developed at the Plone Cioppino Sprint in
        Bodega Bay 2011. The source code is filled with plenty of inside jokes
        and may only be maintainable after drinking copious numbers of
        Manhattans. Without the [drink] support of everyone there, this may not
        have been made possible. Big ups.
