Description: Introduction
        ------------
        
        The product allows you to build a responsive multilevel drop-down menu that will 
        provide your visitors with organized and intuitive navigation. On mobile devices 
        your top menu bar transforms into one drop-down. By clicking on the title or 
        a small arrow next to it all-level menu items appear below the title.
        
        This package allows to build dropdown menu through the web with portal_actions.
        Submenus are built from a tree of nested Category Actions and Actions.
        
        The other strategy used to populate submenus is Plone default NavigationStrategy, 
        the one used in navigation portlet.  
        
        This project is successor of qPloneDropDownMenu. 
        
        Building you dropdown menu with portal_actions
        ==============================================
        
        Starting from Plone 3 portal actions introduced CMF Action Category 
        containers, it opened opportunity to build nested actions trees. Though CMF Action 
        Category does not behave as a regular action, it has different set of properties. 
        We introduced convention in quintagroup.dropdownmenu that requires to have 
        a specially named Action for each Actions Category. The id of each such action 
        must be build using the rule::
          
          action_id = prefix + category_id + suffix
           
        where:
          
        :category_id: is id of correspondent CMF Action Category    
        :prefix: defined in DropDownMenu configlet, default value ''
        :suffix: defined in DropDownMenu configlet, default value '_sub'
        
        So, the actions structure can look like::
        
          + portal_tabs
          |- home
          |- blog_sub
          |-+ blog
          | |-- 2009
          | |-- 2010
             
        By default the root of dropdown menu is 'portal_tabs' category.
        
        Menu caching
        ============
        
        If the menu built with Navigation strategy is entirely public it can be cached for
        all users. If Authenticaded users should see some non public items the menu can be
        cached for anonymous only.
        
        Caching in case of involving the portal_actions strategy is effective only in case
        if all the action are public and have no extra conditions. In case some conditions
        are applied per action switch off caching.
