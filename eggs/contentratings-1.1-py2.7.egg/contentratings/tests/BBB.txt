This tests the BBB versions of the rating adapter, and setup.  We can rate the object using the BBB ``IEditorialRating``::

  >>> from datetime import datetime
  >>> from contentratings.interfaces import IEditorialRating
  >>> rating = IEditorialRating(my_container)
  >>> print rating.rating
  None
  >>> rating.rating = 5
  >>> float(rating.rating)
  5.0
  
We can also test the BBB version of the ``IUserRating`` adapter::

  >>> from contentratings.interfaces import IUserRating
  >>> rating = IUserRating(my_container)
  >>> my_rating = rating.rate(6, 'me')
  >>> your_rating = rating.rate(8, 'you')
  >>> my_rating  is rating.userRating('me')
  True
  >>> float(my_rating)
  6.0
  >>> isinstance(my_rating.timestamp, datetime)
  True
  >>> my_rating.userid
  'me'
  >>> your_rating is rating.userRating('you')
  True
  >>> float(your_rating)
  8.0
  >>> my_rating.timestamp < your_rating.timestamp
  True
  >>> your_rating.userid
  'you'

We can get the average rating and number of ratings as well::

  >>> rating.averageRating
  7.0
  >>> rating.numberOfRatings
  2
