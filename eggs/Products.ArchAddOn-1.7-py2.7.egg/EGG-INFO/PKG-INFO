        =========
        
        Straightforward toolbox of field types, widgets, and validators for
        Archetypes.
        
        Please feel free to add your own new fields, widgets, and validators
        here, if you think they are general-purpose. I intend for this to be
        not sample or learning archetypes add ons (ArchExample is for that),
        but real-world usable toolbox pieces.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        * New Fields for:
        
          - USAddress
        
          - USPhoneNumber
        
          - Email
        
          - Link
        
          - Instruction (only shows description on edit form, for adding
            sectional help or other HTML markup to an edit form)
        
          - DynamicField. This is a textual field that can contain TALES
            expressions which are evaluated. So you can add a "body" field to
            a schema that is of this type, and have it be a mix of HTML
            content and TALES expressions (just like in a ZPT).
        
          - SimpleDataGridField. A lines field with embedded vertical bars for
            fields. If the columns property is set, the isValidGrid validator
            will ensure that the entered text has exactly that number of
            columns for each row.  If strip_whitespace is True, the individual
            cells in the grid will be stripped of leading and trailing
            whitespace (that is, whitespace added around the delimiter).
        
            If column_names is set to a tuple or list of strings, it gives the names
            of columns in the grid. The getDataGridRow script and the getRow() method
            will return a dict using these column names as keys rather than using the
            column numbers (starting from zero).
            Fields are just strings, with no internal validation, etc.
        
        * Matching widgets for these types
        
        * Validators:
        
          - FormattedUSPhoneValidator: (999) 999-9999
        
          - USAddressValidator
        
          - isValidGrid
        
        
        Requires
        --------
        
        Plone version 4.0 or higher.
        
        
        Quickstart
        ----------
        
        1) Use the quickinstaller_tool and install ArchAddOn
        
        2) To create a sample object and test the new fields, widgets, etc.,
           go to the archetype_tool and install the "ArchAddOn Example" type,
           then add an object of that type.
