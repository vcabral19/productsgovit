        Products.PloneboardSubscription enables users to subscribe/unsubscribe to email
        notification to a Ploneboard forum or a particular conversation,
        
        and has an option to automatically add as subscriber a member adding a comment to a conversation.
        
        A "Subscribe/Unsubscribe" link is provided on the forum or conversation
        and if the user chooses to subscribe, any further comments made to the forum
        or conversation triggers an email.
        
        Configuration
        =============
        
        The product creates a tool "portal_pbnotification" at the Plone site which contains some
        parameters that can be set:
        
        * debug mode : if checked, mail is not sent but only logged !
        * send interval : in seconds. The email contains modifications done during the last send interval.
        * last sent : int time of the last send verification (not to be manually changed...)
        * html mail format : must be checked if the email template contains html.
        * mail template : the mail template can be plain text or html.
            The following special parts will be replaced:
                * [PORTAL_TITLE] : by the portal title
                * [URLS] : by the modified conversation urls
                * [FORUMS] : by the modified conversation urls and the corresponding forum (only in html format)
                * [COMMENTS] : by the modified conversation urls, the corresponding forum and the new comments (only in html format)
        * auto_subscribe : if checked, each member adding a comment will be added in the conversation subscribers list.
